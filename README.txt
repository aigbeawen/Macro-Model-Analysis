These are source codes used in development of the article titled 'Determination of Preferred Fiber Orientation State based on Newton-Raphson Method using Exact Jacobian' (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.02663)
The Bfunc routine is the main function file that contains exact derivatives of the different fiber orientation tensor (FOT) models and the different closure approximations, used for steady homogenous flows. 
BfuncC and BfuncR are also function files for unsteady center gated disk flows. All other files are used to assess the perfomance of the Newton-Rapson method using exact Jacobian for different (FOT) models and closure approximations under different flow conditions.
